p=. *Ninth "International Workshop on Modular Ontologies":http://iaoa.org/womo/ (WoMO 2015)*

p<>. Modularity, is an important enabling technology for knowledge repositories and collaborative knowledge development environments. In formal and applied ontology, modularity is central to reducing the complexity of designing and understanding ontologies, and to facilitating ontology verification, reasoning, maintenance and integration.

p<>. This workshop continues a series of successful events that have been an excellent venue for practitioners and researchers to discuss latest and current work on theoretical and practical aspects of modularity in ontologies, bringing together an interdisciplinary crowd of researchers from various subareas of AI spanning knowledge representation, reasoning and logic (description logics, first-order logics, context-based reasoning, rule-based reasoning, automated theorem proving) and web and knowledge-based repositories and information systems (ontologies, semantic web, linked data) as well as researchers from philosophy, logic, cognitive science, and linguistics and from various application domains.

h3. Topics

p<>. Topics of interest to the workshop are modularity in ontologies in the broadest sense. Submissions are welcome irrespective of the ontology language of interest (ranging from informal ontologies such as taxonomies, glossaries, folksonomies, and conceptual models, to formal ontology specified in languages such as RDF(S), OWL, SKOS, first-order logic, Common Logic). Papers may touch on any aspect of modularity, including but not limited to:

* *Philosophical and cognitive aspects of modularity*;
* *Theory, algorithms & implementations:*
** Notions of modularity such as conservative extensions, locality-based modules, reachability modules, etc.
** Module extraction and decomposition algorithms
** Logical relations between modules and modular ontology languages
* *Modularity in reasoning:*
** Modules for incremental and distributed reasoning
** Modularity for schema reasoning (e.g. classification) or.data reasoning (e.g. query answering)
** Modularity and explanations
** Modularity and context-based reasoning
* *Modularity in ontology engineering:*
** Reuse, publishing/sharing, and linking of modules
** Collaborative ontology engineering, ontology versioning and evolution
** Knowledge and ontology repositories, libraries
** Knowledge integration, ontology mapping and alignment
** Ontology design patterns
** Visualizations
* *Modular ontologies in applications:*
** Case studies and evaluations
** Issues in particular domains, e.g., life sciences, physical sciences, geosciences, social sciences, etc.
** End-user applications

p<>. We highly value contributions from all perspectives, including those with a focus on computational, philosophical, cognitive, linguistic, and social aspects. Additionally, contributions that deal with modularity as it arises in specific applications or domains is of interest. We particularly encourage submissions that apply methods beyond classical knowledge representation, such as machine learning and natural language processing approaches, to help further the understanding of modularity.

h3. Paper submission guidelines

p<>. Submissions can be long papers (up to 8 pages) or short papers (up to 4 pages), formatted using the "AAAI style":http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php, submitted in PDF format no later than the submission deadline. All submission are handled through "Easychair":http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jowo15. Use the WoMO track for your submission.

p<>. All submissions will be peer-reviewed by members of the program committee of the individual workshops. Accepted papers will be made available in the form of a joint workshop proceedings.

p<>. The workshop will be open to all attendants of IJCAI'15 and its other workshops. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the workshop and present the paper.
