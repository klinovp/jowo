p=. *Ninth "International Workshop on Modular Ontologies":http://iaoa.org/womo/ (WoMO 2015)*

p<. Modularity, studied for years in software engineering, allows mechanisms for easy and flexible reuse, generalization, structuring, maintenance, design patterns, and comprehension. Modularity is an important enabling technology for knowledge repositories and collaborative knowledge development environments. In formal and applied ontology, modularity is central to reducing the complexity of designing and understanding ontologies, and to facilitating ontology verification, reasoning, maintenance and integration.

p<. Recent research on ontology modularity shows substantial progress in foundations of modularity, techniques of modularization and modular development, distributed reasoning and empirical evaluation. These results provide a solid foundation and exciting prospects for further research and development.

p<. The workshop continues a series of successful events that have been an excellent venue for practitioners and researchers to discuss latest and current work on theoretical and practical aspects of modularity in ontologies, bringing together an interdisciplinary group of researchers from various subareas of AI spanning knowledge representation, reasoning and logic (description logics, first-order logics, context-based reasoning, rule-based reasoning, automated theorem proving) and web and knowledge-based repositories and information systems (ontologies, semantic web, linked data) as well as researchers from philosophy, logic, cognitive science, and linguistics and from various application domains.

h3. Topics

p<. Include but are not limited to:

* *Foundational aspects of modularity*: definition, representation, structure, design patterns, granularity;
* *Logical aspects*: modular (ontology) languages; reconciling inconsistencies across modules; formal structuring of modules; heterogeneity; hybrid theories; intertheory relations (conservativity, interpretability, strong equivalence, inseparability, etc.).
* *Algorithmic & heuristic approaches*: distributed and incremental reasoning; modularization and module extraction techniques; reasoning complexity; system descriptions.
* *Methodological issues* as they occur throughout the ontology lifecycle: publishing/sharing, linking, maintenance, reuse of modules.
* *Knowledge and ontology repositories*: ontology development environments; ontology editors; ontology mapping languages and tools.
* *Analysis and evaluation*: case studies or other analyses of modularizations; quantitative and qualitative ways to measure adequacy of a modularization; comparison of modularizations with respect to philosophical, logical, reasoning, cognitive, or social aspects.
* *Work on closely related approaches*: ontology content patterns; ontology versioning/evolution; context-based reasoning; and modularity issues as they arise in Big Data and Linked Data.
* *Applications*: semantic web; life sciences; earth sciences; bio-ontologies; natural language processing; space and time; ambient intelligence; social intelligence; technology and engineering.
